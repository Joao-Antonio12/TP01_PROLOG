This Prolog program solves a generalized version of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, where the user can define the number of missionaries, cannibals, and the boat's capacity. The objective is to safely transport all individuals from one riverbank to the other without ever allowing the cannibals to outnumber the missionaries on either side, which would result in the missionaries being eaten. The program models the problem using state representations and valid transitions, and applies a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to explore possible sequences of moves that lead to a safe solution. Each state is validated to ensure it adheres to the safety rules. The code was developed and tested in SWISH (https://swish.swi-prolog.org), an online Prolog environment that runs in the browser without installation. The algorithm has exponential time complexity in the worst case due to the growing number of state combinations as the input size increases.
